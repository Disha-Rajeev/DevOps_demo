# DevOps_demo
This is my first project where I am testing out the DevOps knowledge I gained from past few months.
What I am looking forward to achieve-.\
      âœ… End-to-end DevOps pipeline from development to deployment.\
      âœ… CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions/Jenkins.\
      âœ… Containerization & orchestration with Docker & Kubernetes.\
      âœ… AWS infrastructure provisioning using Terraform.\
      âœ… Monitoring & logging for application health tracking.

This project is a great portfolio builder.

# Expense Tracker Web App

This is a simple Expense Tracker web application built using **Flask** with SQLite as the database. It allows users to manage their expenses with features like adding, updating, and deleting expenses. The app also calculates the total expense.

âœ… View total expenses on the home page.\
âœ… Update or delete existing expenses.\
âœ… Uses SQLite for efficient data management.\
âœ… Dockerized for easy deployment and scalability.\
âœ… CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.\

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.9 or above**
- **Flask**
- **SQLite**
- **Docker**
- **Git**

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Disha-Rajeev/DevOps_demo.git
cd DevOps_demo
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate     # On Mac/Linux
env\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Database Setup**

Since the `expenses.db` file is not tracked in Git (added to `.gitignore`), you need to regenerate it:

```bash
python
>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```

**Note:** If `db.create_all()` fails, ensure your `instance/` folder exists. If not, manually create it in the project root.

5. **Run the Flask App**

```bash
python app.py
```

6. **Access the Application**\
   Open your browser and visit:\
   **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**

---

## Docker Setup

1. **Build the Docker Image**

```bash
docker build -t expense-tracker .
```

2. **Run the Container**

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 expense-tracker
```

---

## Running Tests

1. Install **pytest** if not already installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

2. Run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:

- Runs tests using `pytest`.
