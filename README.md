# DevOps_demo
This is my first project where I am testing out the DevOps knowledge I gained from past few months.
What I am looking forward to achieve-
      ✅ End-to-end DevOps pipeline from development to deployment
      ✅ CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions/Jenkins
      ✅ Containerization & orchestration with Docker & Kubernetes
      ✅ AWS infrastructure provisioning using Terraform
      ✅ Monitoring & logging for application health tracking

This project is a great portfolio builder.
